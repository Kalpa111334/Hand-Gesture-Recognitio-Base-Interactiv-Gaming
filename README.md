Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Based-Interactive-Gaming-concept 

Wouldn’t it be fun, if you could use your hand to control the car in a game? So, here we have proposed a computer vision concept to control the game with hand gestures by mapping gestures to the W, A, S, D keyboard keys.

Libraries used:
• python 3.x • imutils • numpy • opencv2 • time • sklearn • ctypes
